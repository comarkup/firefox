# Review Instructions for React Code Renderer

## Test Cases
1. Visit any page with React code (e.g., React documentation)
2. Verify that the "Renderuj" button appears next to React code blocks
3. Click the button to open the renderer popup
4. Test rendering different React components
5. Test the copy to clipboard functionality

## Expected Behavior
- Button appears within 2 seconds of page load
- Popup window shows rendered component
- Error messages appear for invalid code
- Clipboard copy works as expected

## Security Considerations
- Code execution is sandboxed in popup window
- No external API calls
- No data collection or storage

## Test Sites
- https://reactjs.org/docs/
- https://chat.openai.com
- https://claude.ai

## Source Code Verification
All source code is included in the submission and can be reviewed in:
- manifest.json
- content.js
- No minified or obfuscated code is used
